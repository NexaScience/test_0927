    "Open Problems": "Adaptive Score Estimation (ASE) accelerates diffusion sampling by skipping UNet/Transformer blocks according to a hand-crafted, time-dependent dropping schedule.  The manual schedule is (1) sub-optimal, (2) model-specific, and (3) labor-intensive to tune.  How can we let the schedule be found automatically while keeping the ASE framework intact and requiring only a few extra lines of code?",
    "Methods": "Auto-ASE:  Replace the fixed schedule with a tiny, learnable gating function that decides—per time-step t and per network block k—whether the block is executed.  \n1. For every block k add a scalar logit wk (learnable) and define a continuous gate gk(t)=sigmoid(wk·h(t)), where h(t)=1−t (so gates tend to stay open near the data region).  \n2. During training multiply the block output by gk(t).  Use the straight-through estimator (STE) to binarise gk(t) (gk∈{0,1}) at inference time.  \n3. Loss=Lnoise+λ⋅Σk g̅k, where Lnoise is the standard noise-prediction loss and g̅k is the average gate activation over the batch; λ is a small positive constant.  The extra L1 term encourages gates to close, yielding speed-ups.  \n4. No architecture, solver or weight initialisation changes are required; only a few parameters (<100) are added.  Training can be done for a handful of epochs on the original data.",
    "Experimental Setup": "Model: the public DDPM CIFAR-10 UNet (32×32).\nBaselines: (a) original model, (b) ASE with the paper’s linear schedule, (c) proposed Auto-ASE.\nTraining: fine-tune for 1 epoch on CIFAR-10 with batch 128, AdamW lr=1e-4; λ=0.05.\nEvaluation: 50 sampling steps, measure FID (10 k images) and wall-clock time per image on a single RTX-3090.  Report mean gate activations to show the learned schedule.",
    "Experimental Code": "import torch, torch.nn as nn\n\nclass GatedBlock(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, block):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.block = block\n        self.w = nn.Parameter(torch.zeros(1))  # initial gate ~0.5\n    def forward(self, x, t):\n        gate = torch.sigmoid(self.w * (1. - t).view(-1, 1, 1, 1))\n        if self.training:\n            return x + gate * (self.block(x, t) - x), gate.mean()\n        else:  # STE binarisation\n            hard_gate = (gate > 0.5).float()\n            return x + hard_gate * (self.block(x, t) - x), hard_gate.mean()\n\n# Wrap every UNet residual block with GatedBlock and tally gates in loss\n\ngate_loss_coeff = 0.05\n\nfor x, t, noise in dataloader:\n    pred, gate_stats = model(x, t)   # gate_stats is list of means\n    loss = ((pred - noise)**2).mean() + gate_loss_coeff * torch.stack(gate_stats).sum()\n    loss.backward(); optimizer.step()",
    "Expected Result": "Auto-ASE is expected to learn a non-uniform schedule that skips ~40-50 % of blocks at noisy time-steps while keeping almost all blocks near t≈0.  Compared with the hand-crafted ASE schedule, it should deliver (1) equal or slightly better FID (≈16 vs 16.5) and (2) an extra 5-10 % reduction in sampling time because the learned schedule is more aggressive where possible and more conservative where necessary.",
    "Expected Conclusion": "By turning the dropping schedule into a handful of learnable gates plus a sparsity penalty, we remove manual tuning from ASE and obtain a data-driven schedule that generalises across models and datasets.  The modification touches only the loss function and adds negligible parameters, yet it yields measurable speed gains without sacrificing image quality, demonstrating how tiny objective tweaks can meaningfully advance diffusion-model acceleration."

    "Title": "A Simple Early Exiting Framework for Accelerated Sampling in Diffusion Models",
    "Main Contributions": "The paper addresses the slow sampling speed of diffusion models, a practical bottleneck due to repeated score estimation network evaluations. It proposes Adaptive Score Estimation (ASE), a novel early-exiting framework that adaptively allocates compute for score estimation by skipping a subset of network parameters based on a time-dependent exit schedule. The key observation is that computation difficulty varies across time steps (easier near noise, harder near data). ASE significantly improves sampling throughput by approximately 25-30% without compromising image quality, seamlessly integrates with various faster sampling solvers (DDIM, DPM-Solver, DDPM, EM), and reduces processing time per time step. Furthermore, the method demonstrates robustness across different time steps and effectively mitigates the negative transfer phenomenon in diffusion models operating as multi-task learners.",
    "Methodology": "The core methodology is Adaptive Score Estimation (ASE), an early-exiting scheme inspired by techniques used in Large Language Models. It introduces a time-varying block-dropping schedule where more network parameters (blocks) are skipped as the time step 't' approaches 1 (closer to the noise distribution, considered 'noise-easy'), while full parameters are retained as 't' approaches 0 (closer to the data distribution, considered 'data-hard'). A novel fine-tuning algorithm is proposed to adjust the model after block removal, focusing on updating minimal information near t→0 and unseen information near t→1. This fine-tuning process leverages Exponential Moving Average (EMA) for stable, gradual parameter modification and weighted coefficients λ(t) in the loss function to prioritize learning specific score distributions. For DiT architecture, entire building blocks are skipped. For U-ViT, dropping is limited to the decoder part, with linear layers preserved within blocks due to long skip connections, to prevent substantial information loss.",
    "Experimental Setup": "The method was evaluated using three pre-trained diffusion models: DiT XL/2 on ImageNet (256x256), U-ViT-S/4 on CelebA (64x64), and PixArt-α-SAM-256 (fine-tuned on 100K SAM data). Fine-tuning employed a hybrid loss with a re-weighted time coefficient, linear noise schedule, AdamW optimizer (LR 2e-5), cosine annealing LR for U-ViT, and batch sizes of 64 (DiT) or 128 (U-ViT). Forward diffusion used 1000 time steps. Evaluation metrics included Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for image generation quality (5,000 samples, MS-COCO for text-to-image) and wall-clock time on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU for sampling speed. Baselines included DeeDiff, Token Merging (ToMe), and Block Caching (with and without shift-scale adjustment). Compatibility was demonstrated with DDPM, DDIM, DPM-Solver, and Euler-Maruyama (EM) solvers. Ablation studies on U-ViT (CelebA) investigated various time-dependent dropping schedules, and a negative transfer study compared baseline, further-trained, multi-experts, and mixed-k models.",
    "Limitations": "A primary limitation is that the dropping schedule for the early-exiting scheme is manually designed. The paper acknowledges the need for automated methods to find an optimal schedule. Furthermore, the authors highlight general ethical concerns regarding diffusion models: the potential for misuse in generating fake content (deepfakes, misleading information) and the risk of embedding harmful biases and emphasizing stereotypes due to training on internet-sourced data.",
    "Future Research Directions": "The main future research direction identified is to explore automated methods for finding an optimal dropping schedule for the early-exiting scheme. This would alleviate the current manual design process and potentially lead to even more efficient and effective adaptive computation strategies for diffusion models.",

    "Title": "Faster Diffusion: Rethinking the Role of the Encoder for Diffusion Model Inference",
    "Main Contributions": "The paper addresses the slow inference time of diffusion models by proposing a novel acceleration method that does not require retraining or knowledge distillation. It introduces the insight that UNet encoder features change minimally across inference time-steps, unlike decoder features. Based on this, the method omits encoder computation at certain adjacent time-steps and reuses previously computed encoder features, enabling parallel decoder computation for significant speedup. Additionally, a prior noise injection method is introduced to preserve texture details. The approach achieves substantial acceleration (e.g., 41% for Stable Diffusion, 24% for DeepFloyd-IF, 34% for DiT) while maintaining high-quality generation across various tasks including text-to-image, text-to-video, personalized, and reference-guided generation, and is compatible with existing acceleration techniques.",
    "Methodology": "The methodology involves a comprehensive empirical study of UNet features in diffusion models, observing minimal variation in encoder features and substantial variation in decoder features across time-steps. Based on this, 'encoder propagation' is proposed, where encoder computation is omitted at 'non-key' time-steps and cached encoder features from a 'key' time-step are reused. This allows 'parallel non-uniform encoder propagation,' where multiple decoder steps are performed concurrently using the same cached encoder features. 'Non-uniform' key time-step selection prioritizes more encoder computations in earlier inference phases. To mitigate texture degradation caused by encoder propagation, a 'prior noise injection' strategy is introduced, combining the initial latent code zT with zt at later time-steps (t < τ) with a small scaling factor α.",
    "Experimental Setup": "The method was evaluated on Stable Diffusion (SD), DeepFloyd-IF, and Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models. Experiments covered text-to-image generation using 10K prompts from the MS-COCO2017 validation dataset, and 50K images from 1000 ImageNet class labels for DiT. Other tasks included text-to-video (Text2Video-zero, VideoFusion), personalized generation (Dreambooth, Custom Diffusion), and reference-guided generation (ControlNet with edge/scribble conditions), using baseline-aligned settings. Performance was measured by Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) for visual quality, Clipscore for text-image consistency, computational workload (GFLOPs/image), and sampling time (s/image). All inference experiments were conducted on an A40 GPU (48GB VRAM). Comparisons were made against DDIM, DPM-Solver, DPM-Solver++, ToMe, DeepCache, and CacheMe.",
    "Limitations": "The approach faces challenges in maintaining generation quality when using a very limited number of sampling steps (e.g., 5). Furthermore, the paper notes that the proposed parallelization has not yet been explored in combination with network distillation approaches, leaving this direction for future research.",
    "Future Research Directions": "Future research directions include incorporating machine learning algorithms like NSGA-II (or reinforcement learning) for automatically searching and optimizing the selection of 'key time-steps'. Another direction is to explore combining the proposed parallelization scheme with existing network distillation approaches to potentially achieve further acceleration benefits.",

Output:
{'novelty_reason': 'The only prior work that tackles block-skipping for diffusion models is ASE, which employs a hand-crafted, fixed linear schedule.  Auto-ASE turns the schedule itself into a set of learnable, time-conditioned gates trained jointly with the original noise-prediction objective plus a sparsity regulariser.  None of the cited papers (ASE, Faster-Diffusion, DeeDiff, DeepCache, ToMe, etc.) make the dropping policy differentiable, optimise it end-to-end, or perform per-block decisions conditioned on the continuous time-step.  Although learnable gating and straight-through estimators are well-known in dynamic-network literature, their transfer to diffusion sampling—and doing so with <100 extra parameters and no architectural change—is new within this research niche.  Therefore the method is an incremental but genuine contribution beyond existing diffusion-acceleration techniques.', 'novelty_score': 7, 'significance_reason': 'Auto-ASE removes the manual and model-specific hyper-parameter that limited ASE’s practical adoption, offering a plug-and-play, data-driven alternative that can be added to any UNet/Transformer diffusion backbone by editing a few lines of code.  The expected extra 5–10 % wall-clock speed-up at equal FID is modest yet valuable for large-scale or on-device generation where every millisecond and watt matter.  Academically it showcases how dynamic-computation ideas can be ported to generative modeling, potentially inspiring follow-up work on RL-based or Bayesian gate learning.  Socially the impact is limited (does not change capabilities or risks of content generation), but the energy saving is positive.  Overall the significance is moderate.', 'significance_score': 6}
