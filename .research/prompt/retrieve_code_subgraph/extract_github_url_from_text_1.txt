# Paper Outline
The methodology involves a comprehensive empirical study of UNet features in diffusion models, observing minimal variation in encoder features and substantial variation in decoder features across time-steps. Based on this, 'encoder propagation' is proposed, where encoder computation is omitted at 'non-key' time-steps and cached encoder features from a 'key' time-step are reused. This allows 'parallel non-uniform encoder propagation,' where multiple decoder steps are performed concurrently using the same cached encoder features. 'Non-uniform' key time-step selection prioritizes more encoder computations in earlier inference phases. To mitigate texture degradation caused by encoder propagation, a 'prior noise injection' strategy is introduced, combining the initial latent code zT with zt at later time-steps (t < τ) with a small scaling factor α.
