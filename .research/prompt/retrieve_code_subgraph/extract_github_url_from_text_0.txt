# Paper Outline
BOIL operates by considering the joint space of input hyperparameters and the number of training iterations. It compresses the full training curve into a numeric score using a user-preferred Sigmoid function, parameterized by a growth parameter (g0) and a middle point (m0), which are learned by maximizing the Gaussian Process (GP) log marginal likelihood. A cost-sensitive black-box function is modeled using a GP with a product kernel combining similarities over parameter and iteration spaces, while the training cost is approximated by a linear regressor. The next point to evaluate is selected by maximizing a cost-aware acquisition function (a modified Expected Improvement criterion). To enhance sample-efficiency and prevent GP covariance matrix ill-conditioning, BOIL uses a data augmentation technique that selectively samples a subset of points from the observed training curve based on maximal GP predictive uncertainty, adaptively limiting the number of samples to maintain good matrix conditioning.
