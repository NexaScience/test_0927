Input:
# Task
You carefully read the contents of the “Paper Outline” and select one GitHub link from the “GitHub URLs List” that you think is most relevant to the contents.
# Constraints
- Output the index number corresponding to the selected GitHub URL.
- Be sure to select only one GitHub URL.
- If there is no related GitHub link, output None.
# Paper Outline
The methodology is based on an empirical analysis of UNet encoder and decoder features, revealing minimal variation in encoder features and substantial variation in decoder features across time-steps. This insight motivates 'encoder propagation,' where encoder computations are omitted at certain adjacent non-key time-steps, and pre-computed encoder features from previous key time-steps are reused as input for multiple subsequent decoder steps. These multiple decoder steps can then be processed in parallel. Both uniform and non-uniform strategies for selecting key time-steps are explored, with non-uniform performing better. Additionally, a prior noise injection method (combining initial latent code zT into subsequent steps from a specific time-step τ) is introduced to preserve texture details.
