# Paper Outline
The study evaluates both state-of-the-art self-supervised video representation learning methods and community-contributed methods from an open challenge. For video data, methods like Masked Autoencoder (MAE) with ViT-B, MaskFeat with MViTv2-S, and ρBYOL with SlowFast (Slow pathway 8x8) were used, employing pretext tasks such as masking spatio-temporal volumes for reconstruction, predicting HOG features, or contrastive learning with positive samples. Community methods incorporated large pre-trained vision models (BEiT, ResNet, MobileNetV3), variations of contrastive learning (SimCLR, MoCo), trajectory data as additional inputs, and hand-crafted features. For trajectory data, specialized methods like Trajectory Variational Autoencoder (TVAE) for reconstruction, T-Perceiver for temporal relationships and feature reconstruction/prediction, T-GPT for next frame prediction using a Transformer, T-PointNet for permutation-invariant features using PointNet, and T-BERT for agent embeddings via masked modeling and contrastive learning were employed.
