# Paper Outline
The core methodology is based on an empirical analysis of UNet features, showing that encoder features change minimally across time-steps while decoder features vary significantly. This insight motivates 'encoder propagation,' where encoder computation is omitted at certain 'non-key' adjacent time-steps, and features from a previous 'key' time-step's encoder are reused as input for the decoder. This enables parallel execution of multiple decoder steps, leading to faster inference. Two strategies for key time-step selection are proposed: uniform (fixed stride) and non-uniform (more key steps initially, fewer later, based on feature change intensity). A 'prior noise injection' strategy is introduced to preserve texture details, combining the initial latent code zT into subsequent latent codes zt (zt = zt + α · zT) from a specific time-step, which demands negligible computational resources.
